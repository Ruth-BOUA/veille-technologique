Software engineering architecture is the high-level structure of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures. More formally, the architecture of a computer system can be defined as:

- The structure or structures of the system, which comprise elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them.
- The manner in which the structures fulfill the requirements and behaviors of the system.

So what kind of skills do people need to develop to improve the quality of their architectural work? There are a few:

- An increased focus on quality attributes : scalability, performance, security, supportability, and maintainability, to name a few.
- An ability to conceptualize and address system-wide concerns.
- An understanding of the complete lifecycle of a system.
- An ability to balance concerns and compromise.
- An ability to learn from experience and synthesize new approaches.
- An ability to demonstrate leadership.

## Levels  of architechture

- **Application Level**: The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication is usually within one development team.
- **Solution Level**: The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication is between multiple development teams.
- **Enterprise Level**: The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication is across the organization.

## Important skils to learn

- [Thoughtworks radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) for technology watch.
- Documentation is really important.
Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders.
The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders.
